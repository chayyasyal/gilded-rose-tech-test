## Tech Test 2: Gilded Rose

Second practice tech test of week 10. To look at a piece of legacy code, test it
and then refactor it so that it successfully runs and passes.
We are able to do this task in whatever computer language we want to do.
For this task, I have decided to refactor and test in Ruby, because it is a
computer language that I want to become more confident in.
Time limit: 1030 - 1700

## Aims and about task

Write some unit tests myself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases. A failing unit test in a popular test framework has been provided as a starting point for most languages.

Whichever testing approach is chosen, the idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve my skills at designing test cases and refactoring.
The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

## Technologies used
1. Ruby
2. rspec; testing framework

## Methodology used

## Reflection on task
